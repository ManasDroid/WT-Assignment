         Turtles are an order of reptiles known as Testudines, characterized by a shell developed mainly from their
         ribs. Modern turtles are divided into two major groups, the side-necked turtles and hidden neck turtles which
         differ in the way the head retracts. There are 360 living and recently extinct species of turtles, including
         land-dwelling tortoises and freshwater terrapins. They are found on most continents, some islands and, in the
         case of sea turtles, much of the ocean. Like other reptiles, birds, and mammals, they breathe air and do not
         lay eggs underwater, although many species live in or around water. Genetic evidence typically places them in
         close relation to crocodilians and birds.

         Turtle shells are made mostly of bone; the upper part is the domed carapace, while the underside is the flatter
         plastron or belly-plate. Its outer surface is covered in scales made of keratin, the material of hair, horns,
         and claws. The carapace bones develop from ribs that grow sideways and develop into broad flat plates that join
         up to cover the body. Turtles are ectotherms or "cold-blooded", meaning that their internal temperature varies
         with their direct environment. They are generally opportunistic omnivores and mainly feed on plants and animals
         with limited movements. Many turtles migrate short distances seasonally. Sea turtles are the only reptiles that
         migrate long distances to lay their eggs on a favored beach.
