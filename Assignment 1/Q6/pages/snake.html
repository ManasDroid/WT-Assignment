         Snakes are elongated, limbless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes /sɜːrˈpɛntiːz/.[2] Like all
         other squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of
         snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much
         larger than their heads (cranial kinesis). To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as
         kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some
         species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. Lizards have
         evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty-five times independently via
         convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards.[3] These resemble snakes, but several common
         groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not
         universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae).
