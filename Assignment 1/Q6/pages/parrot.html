         Parrots, also known as psittacines are birds of the roughly 398 species[3] in 92 genera
         comprising the order Psittaciformes, found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. The
         order is subdivided into three superfamilies: the Psittacoidea ("true" parrots), the Cacatuoidea (cockatoos),
         and the Strigopoidea (New Zealand parrots). One-third of all parrot species are threatened by extinction, with
         higher aggregate extinction risk (IUCN Red List Index) than any other comparable bird group.[4] Parrots have a
         generally pantropical distribution with several species inhabiting temperate regions in the Southern
         Hemisphere, as well. The greatest diversity of parrots is in South America and Australasia.

         Characteristic features of parrots include a strong, curved bill, an upright stance, strong legs, and clawed
         zygodactyl feet. Many parrots are vividly coloured, and some are multi-coloured. Most parrots exhibit little or
         no sexual dimorphism in the visual spectrum. They form the most variably sized bird order in terms of length.
