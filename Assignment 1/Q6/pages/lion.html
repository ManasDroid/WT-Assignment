         The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to
         Africa and India. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded
         head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually
         dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent
         mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride
         consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female
         lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion
         is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when
         opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species
         typically does not.

         The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but
         when
         persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged
         throughout Africa, Southeast Europe, the Caucasus, and Western and South Asia, but it has been reduced to
         fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as
         Vulnerable
         on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the
         early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the
         decline
         is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.
