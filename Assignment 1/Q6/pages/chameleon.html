         Chameleons or chamaeleons (family Chamaeleonidae) are a distinctive and highly specialized clade of Old World
         lizards with 202 species described as of June 2015.[1] This family is most known for their distinct range of
         colors as they are able to shift in different hues and brightness. Because of the large number of species in
         their family, there is a large variability in their ability to change color. For some, it is more of a shift of
         brightness (shades of brown) whereas others it is a plethora of combinations of colors (reds, yellows, greens,
         and blues).

         Chameleons are distinguished by their zygodactylous feet, their prehensile tail, their laterally compressed
         bodies, their head casques, their projectile tongues, their swaying gait,[2] and crests or horns on their brow
         and snout. Chameleons' eyes are independently mobile, and because of this there are two separate, individual
         images that the brain is analyzing of the chameleon’s environment. When hunting prey, they focus forward in
         coordination, affording the animal stereoscopic vision. The eyes are able to move laterally 180° and vertically
         160°.
