         Kingfishers or Alcedinidae are a family of small to medium-sized, brightly colored birds in the order
         Coraciiformes. They have a cosmopolitan distribution, with most species found in the tropical regions of
         Africa, Asia, and Oceania but also can be seen in Europe. They can be found in deep forests near calm ponds and
         small rivers. The family contains 114 species and is divided into three subfamilies and 19 genera. All
         kingfishers have large heads, long, sharp, pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails. Most species have
         bright plumage with only small differences between the sexes. Most species are tropical in distribution, and a
         slight majority are found only in forests. They consume a wide range of prey usually caught by swooping down
         from a perch. While kingfishers are usually thought to live near rivers and eat fish, many species live away
         from water and eat small invertebrates. Like other members of their order, they nest in cavities, usually
         tunnels dug into the natural or artificial banks in the ground. Some kingfishers nest in arboreal termite
         nests. A few species, principally insular forms, are threatened with extinction. In Britain, the word
         "kingfisher" normally refers to the common kingfisher.
