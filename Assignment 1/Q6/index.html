              Among all the amazing places in Singapore, bird singing club is certainly a noteworthy one. Back in the
              day, Singapore had quite a few such kinds of clubs but the only one that exists today is Kebun Baru Bird
              Singing Club.
              Located close to Ang Mo Kio Garden, this is a sprawling area where you can enjoy the amazing experience of
              bird singing in perpetual harmony. Not only for ornithologists, bird lovers, or nature enthusiasts, the
              concept of bird singing club of Singapore amuses tourists of all kinds.
            </p>

              Bird singing is a vintage tradition of Singapore. Back in the day, local communities used to practice this
              fascinating tradition where plenty of bird cages were kept at Tiong Bahru Bird Arena, a bird corner,
              located at the end of Block 53. The cages used to sway with breeze while the birds sang together in
              perfect harmonious tune.
              This was treated as a major tourist attraction, promoted by Singapore Tourism Board. After the demolition
              of the site and block, this is a nearly extinct tradition now and only a small group of Passionists still
              follow this age-old practice.

              Perfectly set at a foothill in north Singapore, in Ang Mo Kio Garden West, Kebun Baru Bird Singing Club is
              the largest one in entire Southeast Asia. It is a sprawling parkland with 20 feet high poles scattered
              throughout. Numerous decorated bird cages are hosted to the poles. The cages sway in a breeze while the
              birds in them chirp in perfect sync with each other, creating an immensely melodious tune.

              There is also a dedicated place in this bird singing club where birds are kept free for display and
              admiration. One can also experience an amazing parrot parade performed by a macaw, parrots, and
